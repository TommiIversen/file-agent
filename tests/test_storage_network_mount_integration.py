"""
Integration test for StorageMonitorService with NetworkMountService.

Tests the complete integration between storage monitoring and network mount
capabilities, ensuring proper handling of network path failures and recovery.

This test verifies:
1. StorageMonitor detects network mount failures correctly
2. NetworkMountService is called for destination storage issues
3. Mount success/failure is handled properly
4. No regressions in existing storage monitoring functionality
